<h2>A tribute to Doctor WHO...</h2>

<br />

<h3>Why ?</h3>

<p>Because I am a fan !! And I thought I had to do something to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Doctor WHO. So here it is, a little site with no other pretention than listing some of the most famous or not so famous quotes of Doctor WHO. Each day a new quote is be published and you can navigate through all the already published quotes via the arrows (or by using the arrows keys (&larr; &rarr;) of your keyboard).</p>

<br /><br />

<h3>On a technical side :</h3>
