_The Doctor_ _Don't be a fool, Benton! I'm one of you!_

_Android Benton_ _But--_

_The Doctor_ _Didn't you hear the Colonel just now? The Doctor's not here. He's at large somewhere in the complex!_

_Android Benton_ _Oh, yes, of course, sir. I'm sorry, sir._

_The Doctor_ _Oh, that's all right, Benton-- but keep your wits about you. Nobody knows who's who around here!_
