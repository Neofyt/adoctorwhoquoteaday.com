_Herbert_ _I've always wanted to die a hero's death! You know it's funny, when I was at school, everyone used to think I was a coward because I didn't like cricket! If only they could see me now..._

_The Doctor_ _`[through gritted teeth]` Shut, up!_

_Herbert_ _Sorry? Oh yes, of course, you want to concentrate. Sorry!_

_The Doctor_ _Listen Herbert, if you want to do something useful, could you read off the numbers you see on that screen immediately in front of you?_

_Herbert_ _Of course! This one?_

_The Doctor_ _`[exasperated]` How many screens do you see immediately in front of you?_

_Herbert_ _Just the one._

_The Doctor_ _That's the one._
