_Eric Klieg_ _Doctor, you seem to be very familiar with this place._

_The Doctor_ _Oh no, not really, um, it's all based on symbolic logic, the same as you use in computers. The opening mechanism to this door, an or-gate you call it._

_Eric Klieg_ _Yes yes, I can see that, but how did you know in the first place?_

_The Doctor_ _Oh, I used my own special technique._

_Eric Klieg_ _Oh really Doctor, and may we know what that is?_

_The Doctor_ _Keeping my eyes open and my mouth shut._
