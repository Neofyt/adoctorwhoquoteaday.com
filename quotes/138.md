_Sarah Jane_ _What's gone wrong this time?_

_The Doctor_ _Nothing. Nothing at all. What makes you think something's gone wrong?_

_Sarah Jane_ _Because you always get rude when you're trying to cover up a mistake._

_The Doctor_ _Nothing of consequence. Slight overshoot, easily rectified._

_Sarah Jane_ _Come on, where are we?_

_The Doctor_ _We've come out of the time vortex at the wrong point, that's all. A few years too late._

_Sarah Jane_ _How many?_

_The Doctor_ _...30,000._
