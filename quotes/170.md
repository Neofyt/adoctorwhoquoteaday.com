_The Twelfth Doctor_ _Doctor, I let you go. `[Finally, after refusing to change for so long, [The Doctor regenerates, the energy causing severe damage to the TARDIS interior. A new face emerges - The Thirteenth Doctor, this time female. She pauses in awe and then pulls the console scanner round to get a look at her new face.]`_

_The Thirteenth Doctor_ _Oh, brilliant! `[She presses a button and The TARDIS goes into a state of frenzy, throwing her to the ground. The TARDIS doors open and The Doctor, in a panic state, holds onto the console for dear life. However, the console gives way and she is sent flying out of the ship which then dematerialises in front of her eyes as she plummets high up in the sky towards Earth.]`_
