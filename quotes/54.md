_The Doctor_ _Don't challenge me, Harriet Jones! 'Cause I'm a completely new man! I could bring down your government with a single word!_

_Harriet Jones_ _You're the most remarkable man I've ever met. But I don't think you're quite capable of that._

_The Doctor_ _No, you're right. Not a single word; just six._

_Harriet Jones_ _I don't think so._

_The Doctor_ _Six words._

_Harriet Jones_ _Stop it!_

_The Doctor_ _Six. `[walks over to Alex and whispers to him]` Don't you think she looks tired?_
