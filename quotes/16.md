_The Doctor_ _So what about your mum and dad, then? Are they upstairs? I thought we'd have woken them by now._

_Amelia_ _I don't have a mum and dad, just an aunt._

_The Doctor_ _I don't even have an aunt._

_Amelia_ _You're lucky._

_The Doctor_ _I know._

_The Doctor_ _So your aunt, where's she?_

_Amelia_ _She's out._

_The Doctor_ _Has she left you all alone?!_

_Amelia_ _I'm not scared!_

_The Doctor_ _Of course you're not! You're not scared of anything! Box falls out of the sky, man falls out of the box, man eats fish custard, and look at you! Just sitting there! So you know what I think?_

_Amelia_ _What?_

_The Doctor_ _Must be a hell of a scary crack in your wall._
