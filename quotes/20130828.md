_Lucius_ _Is that so? Man from Gallifrey._

_The Doctor_ _What?_

_Lucius_ _The strangest of images; your home is lost in fire, is it not?_

_Donna Noble_ _Doctor, what are they doing?_

_Lucius_ _And you, daughter of... London!_

_Donna Noble_ _How does he know that?_

_Lucius_ _It is the gift of Pompeii, every single oracle tells the truth._

_Donna Noble_ _But that's impossible._

_Lucius_ _Doctor, she is returning._

_The Doctor_ _Who is? Who's she?_

_Lucius_ _And you, daughter of London, there is something on your back._

_Donna Noble_ _What's that mean?_

_Evelina_ _Even the word Doctor is false. Your real name is hidden, it burns in the stars, in the cascade of Medusa herself. You are a Lord, sir. A Lord of Time._
