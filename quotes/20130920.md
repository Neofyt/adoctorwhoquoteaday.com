_The Doctor_ _So the year 5 billion. The Sun expands, the Earth gets roasted._

_Rose_ _That was our first date._

_The Doctor_ _We had chips. [Rose chuckles] So anyway, planet gone. All rocks and dust, but the human race lives on spread out across the stars. Soon as the Earth burns up, ooh, they get all nostalgic, big revival movement. They find this place. Same size as the Earth. Same air, same orbit. Lovely. The call goes out, the humans move in._

_Rose_ _What's the city called?_

_The Doctor_ _New New York._

_Rose_ _Oh, come on._

_The Doctor_ _It is! It's the city of New New York! Strictly speaking, it's the fifteenth New York since the original, so that makes it New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New New York._
