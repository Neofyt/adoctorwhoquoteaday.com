_The Doctor_ _I don't suppose you've completely ignored my instructions and secretly prepared any Nitro-9, have you?_

_Ace_ _What if I had?_

_The Doctor_ _And naturally, you wouldn't do anything so insanely dangerous as to carry it around with you, would you?_

_Ace_ _Of course not. I'm a good girl and do what I'm told._

_The Doctor_ _Excellent. Blow up that vehicle._
