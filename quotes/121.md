_&nbsp;_ _`[Mickey is gingerly holding down a button on the TARDIS console.]`_

_The Doctor_ _`[smiling]` Umm... what are you doing that for?_

_Mickey_ _Cause you told me to._

_The Doctor_ _`[smile slowly fades]` When was that?_

_Mickey_ _About half an hour ago._

_The Doctor_ _`[sheepish]` Umm... you can let go now._

_&nbsp;_ _`[Mickey lets go to an audible 'bleep' from the TARDIS. Rose quietly giggles.]`_

_Mickey_ _How long has it been since I could've stopped?_

_The Doctor_ _Ten minutes? Twenty? Twenty-nine?_
