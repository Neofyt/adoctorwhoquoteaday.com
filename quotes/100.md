_&nbsp;_ _`[The War Doctor deciding whether to destroy Gallifrey or not]`_

_The War Doctor_ _I have no desire to survive this._

_The Moment_ _Then that's your punishment. If you do this, if you kill them all, then that's the consequence. You... live. Gallifrey... you're going to burn it... and all those Daleks with it, but all those children too. How many children on Gallifrey right now?_

_The War Doctor_ _I don't know._

_The Moment_ _One day, you will count them. One terrible night._
