_D.I. Bishop_ _We just found another one. `[brings in the latest victim: Rose, her face covered by a blanket]`_

_The Doctor_ _`[furious]` What! They left her where?_

_D.I. Bishop_ _The street._

_The Doctor_ _They took her face and just chucked her out in the street. As a consequence that makes this simple... very, very simple. Because now, Detective Inspector Bishop, there is no power on this earth that can stop me!_
