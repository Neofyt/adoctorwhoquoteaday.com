_The Doctor_ _And, I'll tell you something elseâ€”we just met Queen Victoria!_

_Rose Tyler_ _Oh, I know! She was just sitting there._

_The Doctor_ _Like a stamp!_

_Rose Tyler_ _I wanted to say `[imitating Queen Victoria]` "we are not amused". Bet you five quid I can make her say it._

_The Doctor_ _Well if I gambled on that, it'd be an abuse of my privilege as a traveler in time._

_Rose Tyler_ _Ten quid?_

_The Doctor_ _Done._
