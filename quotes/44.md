_&nbsp;_ _`[inside the TARDIS, the Doctor is regenerating. Ben and Polly watch in amazement as the frail old man changes into a younger figure. Ben and Polly discuss the "new" Doctor lying on the floor of the TARDIS]`_

_Polly_ _His face, his hair. Look at it!_

_Ben_ _He's breathing, and the TARDIS seems to be normal._

_Polly_ _Ben, what are we going to do? We can't just leave the Doctor there._

_Ben_ _What, him? The Doctor?_

_Polly_ _Well that's who came through the doors - there was no one else outside. Ben, do you remember what he said in the tracking room? Something about "This old body of mine is wearing a bit thin"._

_Ben_ _So he gets himself a new one?_
