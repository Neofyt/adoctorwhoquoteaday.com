_The Doctor_ _Will you stop this nonsense?_

_Mestor_ _No, Time Lord!_

_The Doctor_ _Then take the consequences!_

_&nbsp;_ _`[the Doctor throws a vial of acid at Mestor, but it hits an invisible forcefield and explodes into a cloud of smoke, leaving Mestor unharmed]`_

_Mestor_ _You think I would be so vulnerable? You are an interfering fool!_

_The Doctor_ _No, just a rotten shot._
