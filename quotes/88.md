_The War Doctor_ _Are you capable of speaking without flapping your hands about?_

_The Eleventh Doctor_ _`[waves hands]` Yes. No. `[turns back to the guards]` I demand to be incarcerated in the Tower immediately with my co-conspirators, Sandshoes and Grandad._

_The War Doctor_ _Grandad?!_

_The Tenth Doctor_ _They're not sandshoes!_

_The War Doctor_ _Yes, they are!_
