_&nbsp;_ _`[the Doctor, Jack and Rose are cornered by the empty children.]`_

_The Doctor_ _Go to your room! Go to your room! I mean it. I'm very, very angry with you. I'm very, very cross! Go! To! Your! Room! `[the children lurch away and obey him.]` I'm really glad that worked. Those would have been terrible last words._
