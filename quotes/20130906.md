_Clara_ _Who's that?_

_The Doctor_ _Never mind. Let's get back._

_Clara_ _Who is he?_

_The Doctor_ _He's me. There's only me here, that's the point. Now let's get back._

_Clara_ _But I never saw that one. I saw all of you. Eleven faces. All of them you._

_The Doctor_ _I said he was me. I never said he was the Doctor._

_Clara_ _But I don't understand._

_The Doctor_ _My name, my real name, that is not the point. The name I chose is the Doctor. The name you choose, it's like, it's like a promise you make. He's the one who broke the promise. Clara? Clara! He is my secret._

_The Forgotten Doctor_ _What I did, I did without choice._

_The Doctor_ _I know._

_The Forgotten Doctor_ _In the name of peace and sanity._ 

_The Doctor_ _But not in the name of the Doctor._
