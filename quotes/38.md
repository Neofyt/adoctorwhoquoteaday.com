_Dalek_ _Listen... to... me!_

_The Doctor_ _Yes?_

_Dalek_ _Stop... our power... from... wasting... or it will be... end... of the... Daleks!_

_The Doctor_ _Even if I wanted to, I don't know how. `[The Dalek exclaims loudly and its eyestalk flies upwards before it becomes motionless]`_

_Alydon_ _It's finished. The final war. Five hundred years of destruction end in this._
