_The Doctor_ _Your race is dead! You all burnt, all of you! Ten million ships on fire! The entire Dalek race wiped out in one second!_

_Dalek_ _You lie!_

_The Doctor_ _I watched it happen! I made it happen!_

_Dalek_ _You destroyed us?!_

_The Doctor_ _`[somber]` I had no choice._

_Dalek_ _And what of the Time Lords?_

_The Doctor_ _Dead. They burnt with you. The end of the last great Time War. Everyone lost._

_Dalek_ _And the coward survived._

_The Doctor_ _`[mocking]` Oh, and I caught your little signal. "Help me". Poor little thing. But there's no one else coming 'cause there's no one else left._

_Dalek_ _I am alone in the universe?_

_The Doctor_ _`[smirking]` Yep._

_Dalek_ _So are you. `[the Doctor's smirk fades]` We are the same._

_The Doctor_ _`[enraged]` We are not the same! I'm not - No, wait. Maybe we are. You're right. Yeah, okay. You've got a point. 'Cause I know what to do. I know what should happen. I know what you deserve. Exterminate! `[he pulls a nearby lever, causing the Dalek to be electrified. The Dalek screams.]`_

_Dalek_ _Have pity!_

_The Doctor_ _Why should I? You never did!_
