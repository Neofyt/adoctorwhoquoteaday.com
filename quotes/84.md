_Grace_ _`[sceptically]` Okay, you're trying to tell me you came back from the dead?_

_The Doctor_ _Yes._

_Grace_ _No, sorry, the dead stay dead. You can't turn back time._

_The Doctor_ _Yes, you can._

_Grace_ _I'm not child. Don't treat me like I'm child, only children believe that crap. I am a doctor._

_The Doctor_ _But it was a childish dream that made you a doctor. `[Grace looks back at him, shocked]` You dreamt you could hold back death. Isn't that true? Don't be sad, Grace. You'll do great things._
