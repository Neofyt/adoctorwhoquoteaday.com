_The Doctor_ _This is bad, I don't like this. `[kicks console and yells in pain]` Never use force, you just embarrass yourself. Unless you're cross, in which case... always use force!_

_Amy_ _Shall I run and get the manual?_

_The Doctor_ _I threw it in a supernova._

_Amy_ _You threw the manual in a supernova? Why?_

_The Doctor_ _Because I disagreed with it! Now stop talking to me when I'm cross!_
