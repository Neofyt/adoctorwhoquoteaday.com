_The Doctor_ _I'm a Time Lord._

_Sarah Jane_ _Oh, I know you're a Time Lord._

_The Doctor_ _You don't understand the implications... I'm not a human being, I walk in eternity..._

_Sarah Jane_ _What's that supposed to mean?_

_The Doctor_ _It means I've lived for something like 750 years._

_Sarah Jane_ _All right, so you're middle aged!_

_The Doctor_ _Yes! About time I found something to do than run around after the Brigadier._
