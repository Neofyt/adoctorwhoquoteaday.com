_The Doctor_ _Didn't anyone ever tell you? There's one thing you never put in a trap. If you're smart, if you value your continued existence, if you have any plans about seeing tomorrow, there's one thing you never, ever put in a trap._

_Angel Bob_ _And what would that be, sir?_

_The Doctor_ _Me._
