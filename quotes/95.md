_Ace_ _It's true isn't it. This is the house I told you about._

_Doctor_ _You were thirteen. You climbed over the wall for a dare._

_Ace_ _That's your surprise isn't it? Bringing me back here._

_Doctor_ _Remind me what it was that you sensed when you entered this deserted house. An aura of intense evil?_

_Ace_ _Don't you have things you hate?_

_Doctor_ _I can't stand burnt toast. I loathe bus stations. Terrible places. Full of lost luggage and lost souls._

_Ace_ _I told you I never wanted to come back here again._

_Doctor_ _And then there's unrequited love. And tyranny. And cruelty._

_Ace_ _Too right!_

_Doctor_ _We all have a universe of our own terrors to face._

_Ace_ _I face mine on my own terms._
