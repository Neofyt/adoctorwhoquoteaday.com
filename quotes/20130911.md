_Rose Tyler_ _Doctor, tell me what's going on._

_The Doctor_ _I absorbed all the energy of the time vortex and no one's meant to do that. Every cell in my body's dying._

_Rose Tyler_ _Can't you do something?_

_The Doctor_ _Yeah, I'm doing it now... Time Lords have this little trick, it's sort of a way of cheating death, except, it means I'm gonna change. And I'm not gonna see you again, not like this, not with this daft old face. And before I go..._

_Rose Tyler_ _Don't say that!_

_The Doctor_ _Rose, before I go I just wanna tell you - you were fantastic... absolutely fantastic... and d'you know what?... So was I._
