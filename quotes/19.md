_Amy Pond_ _I go to parties and I...kiss people... `[clears throat]` with outfits. It's a laugh!_

_The Doctor_ _You were a little girl five minutes ago!_

_Amy Pond_ _You're worse than my aunt!_

_The Doctor_ _I'm the Doctor; I'm worse than everybody's aunt! `[catches himself]` And that is not how I'm introducing myself._
