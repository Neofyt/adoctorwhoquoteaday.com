_The Doctor_ _All those times I’ve been on Earth, I’ve never heard of you._

_Yvonne Hartman_ _Well, of course not. You’re the enemy. You’re actually named in the Torchwood Foundation Charter of 1879 as an enemy of the crown._

_The Doctor_ _1879? That was called Torchwood. That house in Scotland._

_Yvonne Hartman_ _That’s right. Where you encountered Queen Victoria and the werewolf._

_Jackie_ _I think he makes half of it up._

_Yvonne Hartman_ _Her Majesty created the Torchwood Institute with the express intention of keeping Britain great and fighting the alien horde._

_The Doctor_ _But if I’m the enemy, does that mean I’m a prisoner?_

_Yvonne Hartman_ _Oh, yes. But we’ll make you perfectly comfortable._
