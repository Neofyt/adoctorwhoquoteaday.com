_Striker_ _You are not an Ephemeral. You are a... a time dweller. You travel in time._

_The Doctor_ _You're reading my thoughts._

_Striker_ _You are a Time Lord, a lord of time. Are there lords in such a small domain?_

_The Doctor_ _And where do you function?_

_Striker_ _Eternity. The endless wastes of eternity._
