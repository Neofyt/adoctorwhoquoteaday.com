_The Doctor_ _You think it'll last forever: people and cars and concrete. But it won't. One day it's all gone. Even the sky. `[long pause]` My planet's gone. It's dead. It burned, like the Earth. It's just rocks and dust. Before its time._

_Rose_ _What happened?_

_The Doctor_ _There was a war, and we lost._

_Rose_ _A war with who? `[The Doctor doesn't answer, seemingly lost in thought.]` What about your people?_

_The Doctor_ _I'm a Time Lord. I'm the last of the Time Lords. They're all gone. I'm the only survivor. I'm left traveling on my own, 'cause there's no one else._

_Rose_ _There's me._

_The Doctor_ _You've seen how dangerous it is â€” do you want to go home?_

_Rose_ _I don't know...I want...Oh, can you smell chips?_

_The Doctor_ _Yeah. `[laughs]` Yeah!_

_Rose_ _I want chips._

_The Doctor_ _Me too._

_Rose_ _Right then, before you get me back in that box, chips it is. And you can pay._

_The Doctor_ _`[pats down his pockets]` No money._

_Rose_ _`[laughs slightly]` What sort of date are you? Come on then, tight wad, chips are on me...we've only got five billion years 'til the shops close!_
