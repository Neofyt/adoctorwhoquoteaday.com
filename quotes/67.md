_Jo_ _Doctor, I thought the TARDIS was working again?_

_The Doctor_ _What gave you that idea?_

_Jo_ _Well, being dragged 500 years into the future, for example? I mean, all that business with the miners and the colonists._

_The Doctor_ _My dear Jo, the TARDIS was working then because it was being operated under remote control by the High Council of the Time Lords._

_Jo_ _Well, if it worked for them-_

_The Doctor_ _I don't want it to work for them: I want it to work for me. No one's going to turn me into an interplanetary puppet._
