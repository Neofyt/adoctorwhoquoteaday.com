_The Doctor_ _`[working on his TARDIS console, singing]` I don't want to set the world on fire... `[BANG! Smoke comes out of the TARDIS door, followed by the Doctor carrying a piece of dematerialization mechanism. He goes to the lab bench and places it in a device clearly designed to hold the three legged item. There is a knock at the door.]` Not today, thank you._
