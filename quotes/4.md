_The Cyber Controller_ _You belong to us. You shall be like us._

_The Professor_ _How did you know we would release you? You could have remained frozen forever._

_The Cyber Controller_ _The humanoid mind. You are inquisitive._

_The Doctor_ _Ah, I see. A trap. A very special sort of trap too._

_The Professor_ _What do you mean special trap?_

_The Doctor_ _They wanted superior intellects. That's why they made the trap so complicated!_

_The Cyber Controller_ _We knew that somebody like you would come to our planet someday._

_The Doctor_ _Yes. We've done exactly as you calculated, haven't we?_

_The Cyber Controller_ _Now you belong to us_
