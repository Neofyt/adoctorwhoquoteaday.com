_Martha_ _But are we safe? Can we move around and stuff?_

_The Doctor_ _Of course we can. Why do you ask?_

_Martha_ _It's like in the films! You step on a butterfly, you change the future of the human race!_

_The Doctor_ _I'll tell you what, then: don't...step on any butterflies. What have butterflies ever done to you?_

_Martha_ _What if...I dunno! What if I kill my grandfather?!_

_The Doctor_ _Are you planning to?_

_Martha_ _No._

_The Doctor_ _Well, then._
