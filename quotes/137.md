_The Doctor_ _Well, I can tell you where your three astronauts are._

_Carrington_ _Well?_

_The Doctor_ _They're still in orbit._

_Carrington_ _But they came down the capsule. They were here. I saw them._

_The Doctor_ _No, you saw three spacesuits. I don't know what came down in Recovery 7, but it certainly wasn't human!_
