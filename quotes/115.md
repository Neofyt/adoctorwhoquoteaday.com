_The Doctor_ _Well good now he's gone, any chance of a cup of tea?_

_Kaled Guard Tane_ _What?!_

_The Doctor_ _Or coffee. My friend and I have had a trying experience â€” haven't we had a trying experience, Harry?_

_Sullivan_ _Very trying, Doctor!_

_Kaled Guard Tane_ _Step into the security scan!_

_The Doctor_ _What, no tea?_

_Kaled Guard Tane_ _Let me point out to you that you have no rights whatsoever. I have full authority to torture and kill any prisoner who does not comply absolutely with my orders. That is your first and last warning._

_The Doctor_ _No tea, Harry._
