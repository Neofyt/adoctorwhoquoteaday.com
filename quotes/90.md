_The Doctor_ _I suppose you've come for me?_

_Cyberman 1_ _You know our ways._

_The Doctor_ _Yes, I hoped you realised somebody did. I imagine you have orders to destroy me?_

_Cyberman 1_ _Yes._

_The Doctor_ _Tell me one thing, why did you order Duggan to destroy radio communication with the Earth? After all, that is why you want possession of the wheel, isn't it?_

_Cyberman 1_ _You know our ways._

_The Doctor_ _That doesn't answer my question._

_Cyberman 2_ _He was instructed to destroy only the transmitting complex._

_The Doctor_ _Oh, I see, how interesting, yes, of course. And presumably your large space-ship holds your invasion fleet, and the smaller ships can only enter the planet's atmosphere by homing on a radio beam._

_Cyberman 1_ _You know our ways. You must be destroyed._

_The Doctor_ _Yes, I was afraid you'd get back to that._
