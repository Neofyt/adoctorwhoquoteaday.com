_Taron_ _Doctor, we'd never have succeeded without all your help. I wish there was some way of thanking you._

_The Doctor_ _As a matter of fact, there is._

_Rebec_ _Yes, Doctor?_

_The Doctor_ _Throughout history, you Thals have always been known as one of the most peace-loving races in the galaxy._

_Taron_ _I hope we always will be._

_The Doctor_ _Yes, that's what I mean. When you get back to Skaro, you'll all be national heroes. Everybody'll want to hear about your adventures._

_Taron_ _Of course._

_The Doctor_ _So be careful how you tell that story, will you? Don't glamourise it. Don't make war sound like an exciting and thrilling game._

_Taron_ _`[smiles]` I understand._

_The Doctor_ _Tell them about the members of your mission that will not be returning. Like Maro, Vaber and Marat. Tell them about the fear. Otherwise your people might relish the idea of war. We don't want that._
