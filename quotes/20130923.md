_Rose_ _My mother's cooking._

_The Doctor_ _Good. Put her on a slow heat and let her simmer._

_Rose_ _She's cooking tea. For us._

_The Doctor_ _I don't do that._

_Rose_ _She wants to get to know you._

_The Doctor_ _Tough. I've got better things to do._

_Rose_ _It's just tea._

_The Doctor_ _Not to me, it isn't._

_Rose_ _She's my mother!_

_The Doctor_ _Well, she's not mine!_

_Rose_ _That's not fair!_

_The Doctor_ _Well, you can stay there if you want! But right now, there's this plasma storm brewing in the Horsehead Nebula. Fires are burning, ten million miles wide. I could fly the TARDIS right into the heart of it, then ride the shock wave all the way out, hurtle right across the sky and end up... anywhere. Your choice._
