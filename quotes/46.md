_Grace_ _Maybe you're the result of some weird genetic experiment._

_The Doctor_ _I don't think so._

_Grace_ _But you have no recollection of family?_

_The Doctor_ _No... No-no-no-no-wait-wait-wait-wait... I remember I'm-I-I... I'm with my father, we're lying back in the grass, it's a warm Gallifreyan night--_

_Grace_ _Gallifreyan?_

_The Doctor_ _Gallifrey! Yes! This must be where I live. Now, where is that?_

_Grace_ _I've never heard of it! What do you remember?_

_The Doctor_ _A meteor storm. The sky above us was dancing with lights! Purple, green, brilliant yellow... Yes!_

_Grace_ _What?!_

_The Doctor_ _These shoes! `[Stomps the ground happily.]` They fit perfectly!_
