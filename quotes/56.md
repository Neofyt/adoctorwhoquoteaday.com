_The War Doctor_ _Did you ever count?_

_The Eleventh Doctor_ _Count what?_

_The War Doctor_ _How many children there were on Gallifrey that day?_

_The Eleventh Doctor_ _I have absolutely no idea._

_The War Doctor_ _How old are you now?_

_The Eleventh Doctor_ _Uh, I don't know, I lose track. Twelve hundred and something, I think, unless I'm lying. I can't remember if I'm lying about my age, that's how old I am._

_The War Doctor_ _Four hundred years older than me and in all that time you never even wondered how many there were. You never once counted?_

_The Eleventh Doctor_ _Tell me, what would be the point?_

_The Tenth Doctor_ _Two point four seven billion._

_The War Doctor_ _You did count!_

_The Tenth Doctor_ _`[to the Eleventh Doctor]` You forgot! Four hundred years, is that all it takes?!_

_The Eleventh Doctor_ _I moved on!_

_The Tenth Doctor_ _Where?! Where can you be now that you can forget something like that?!_

_The Eleventh Doctor_ _Spoilers._
