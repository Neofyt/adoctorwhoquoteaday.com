_The Doctor_ _My goodness, no. Don't you realise that when I was stranded on this little planet of yours, I had nothing but these clothes that I Oh, my goodness!_

_Liz_ _What is it, Doctor?_

_The Doctor_ _Well, I've just realised. I don't even own these. I borrowed them from the hospital. And there's that car, too. Yes, you know, I took to that car. It had character._

_Brigadier_ _No, Doctor. That car must be returned to its owner._

_Doctor_ _Must it? Yes, yes, I suppose it must. Still, there's no reason why you couldn't find me something similar, is there? I mean, it could persuade me to stay, you know._

_Brigadier_ _Oh, very well._

_Doctor_ _Good. When can we go and choose it?_

_Brigadier_ _Not yet. I must arrange for a full set of papers first. By the way, I've just realised. I don't even know your name._

_Doctor_ _Smith. Doctor John Smith._
