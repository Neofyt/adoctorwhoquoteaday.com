_Doctor_ _Have you noticed these rather strange scratches, Commander?_

_Commander Stevenson_ _Can’t say that I have._

_Doctor_ _All over the ship. I’ve seen them somewhere before, if only I could remember where._

_Commander Stevenson_ _What is it?_

_Doctor_ _I’ve just made a third interesting discovery about your plague virus, Commander._

_Commander Stevenson_ _A third?_

_Doctor_ _Yes. One, it scratches metal. Two, it attacks its victims so suddenly that they become unconscious before they can even raise the alarm, and three…_

_Commander Stevenson_ _Go on._

_Doctor_ _It removes tape from radio logs. It must be a very literate and inquisitive virus._
